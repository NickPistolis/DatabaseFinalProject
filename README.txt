##Application Description

This application keeps track of movies and books in inventory. Its primary purpose would be use in a library to manage its inventory. People can check out a book or movie and its reflected in the main page where the current inventory is displayed. When a new book or movie arrives it can be added via the two buttons on the home page, one for each. If its desired to remove a book/movie from the shelves, you can also delete them from the system. Most of the time, users will use the middle 2 buttons, checking out a book or movie. When the current stock of a particular book or movie is above 0, it means its free to check out and come to our physical location to pick it up. When below 0, it means its a backorder and more of that book/movie need to be returned or purchased by the library to keep up with demand.
